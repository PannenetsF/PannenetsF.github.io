LOTS of companies have public APIs, but some of them don't always make full use of them. E.g. some frontends are too bad to support a large number of files. I have to say, it is even much more convenient to use the API than the frontend, which you no long suffer from stuck-stuck-stuck.

Good APIs can motivate hacking guys to create more interesting things. Even better than the companies' own products. 

E.g, One can use A-B-C APIs to chain up a new (self-using) product, which may be infeasible for the company itself due to lots of copyright issues.

It recalls me of the langchain works. I think it a reasonable way to enrich and connect the world.
