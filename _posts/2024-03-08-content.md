Editing is one of the most frequent tasks I do everyday. My editing tasks are mainly about coding for projects, noting for literals and writing slides for presentations. 

There can be too lots of tools to do these tasks: you can choose the editor (vim, emacs, vscode, etc.); you can choose your note tools (notion, obsidian, etc.); you can choose your slide tools (powerpoint, keynote, beamer, etc.).

But recently, I found myself tired about that. In fact, no matter what tools I use, the contents are the same. I am just editing.

For me, figures are not as important as pure texts. So I decided to omit the note-taking apps which support figures, and just used my nvim. When I have to deal with figures, maybe beamers are enough.

Of course, good-looking notes can make me a day, but it can never help with the progress or even harm a lot. 

Just keep simple, and keep editing. Only make things complex when necessary.
