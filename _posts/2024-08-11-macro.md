Did some overleaf work today, which requires removing all delete tags in the file, i.e. `\sout{foo-bar}`. This operation is repetitive (find the command, then enter visual mode, move forward 2 words, find the match of the bracket) and can be automated with vim macro. After recording it with key `q`, then `:g//normal! @q` to apply it to all matches. 

Similarly, I used `:g//normal! @q` to remove all the `\revise` tags in the file. Thought brackers were left behind, it's okay for me. 

Suprisingly, it is the first time I used vim macro for 4 years since I started vim. Never thought the regex or `:g` command can be so powerful.
