Hi, I'm Yunqian (范云潜), a second-year M.Sc. student majoring in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University. My research focuses on enhancing the efficiency of Machine Learning Systems, particularly in the areas of inference and serving. I am currently under the supervision of Prof. Rui Fan at the Parallel Processing Laboratory (PPL). 

Before entering ShanghaiTech, I obtained my B.Eng at Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Wang Kang. Additionally, I have been an intern at Model Toolchain Team at SenseTime Research for more than two years.
